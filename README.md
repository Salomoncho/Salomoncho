I'm a Telecommunications Engineer and Software Developer with 3 years of experience.I worked at the I+D area for the telecom industry for 3 years, and during that time, I have learned that no matter how accurate your machine learning model is, or how good the  RPA statistics are, if you don't show it and explaining it to the world in simple terms. I'd understood the power of data visualization which motivated me to develop web User Interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JS frameworks like React.
