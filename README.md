I'm a Telecommunications Engineer and Software Developer with 3 years of experience.I worked at the I+D area for the telecom industry for 3 years, and during that time, I have learned that no matter how accurate your code is, or how good the  RPA statistics are, if you don't show it and explaining it to the world in simple terms. That motivated me to develop web User Interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JS frameworks like React.

Teammates who work with me always highlight my dedication, passion about what I do,my responsibility, and constant improvement. I worked with Python (automation, web scrapping and computer vision libraries), Tensorflow, React, NodeJs, Django, Rest-framework, Swagger, Jest, Heroku, MongoDB, and MSSQL to create automation products and web apps.
